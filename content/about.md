## About the FIRST Robotics Competition

FIRST is a global robotics community preparing young people for the future and the world's leading youth-serving nonprofit advancing STEM education.

Combining the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. The FIRST Robotics Competition is the ultimate Sport for the Mind. 

Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. Itâ€™s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting FIRST Championship.



## About Us

Connecting minds worldwide, we collaborate as a team to create a competitive robot to inspire those similarly interested in STEM.
Through FRC, we surpass our creative limits and explore our curiosity in all corners of engineering by challenging ourselves, applying our learned skills, and innovating theory into reality to build an industrialized robot.
